# cavitation_detection_pump
TinyML system for firefighting pump anomaly detection using ESP32 &amp; ADXL345. It employs a custom autoencoder trained on self-collected vibration data via Edge Impulse to monitor vibrations in real-time, detect cavitation, and trigger automatic shutdown to prevent equipment damage.
